5,wallstreetbets,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post","So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",0.9,1168.0,0.0,1168.0

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  üöÄ üåö üåù üåö üåù üöÄ

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! üöÄ üöÄ

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

Here's what happened yesterday, Jun 7:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of close Jun 7. Party's just getting started.](https://preview.redd.it/ryzbn23dk1a71.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6754652617bb06a94073f956a20e8a5d4f2208)

Here's today (Jun 8) @ 2pm:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of Jun 8 @ 2:00 pm](https://preview.redd.it/27rv3txdk1a71.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85368ee2baa4981d737a831572dce16024a6379)

The IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

\---

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China‚Äôs total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúSteel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,‚Äù said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

\---

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. üåà STEELGBTQ üåà (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

Then I did the math. ‚ÄúOh look, I can buy 100 shares for $55. Then I can buy a $55 put for $300.

Wrong. 

The issue with the special dividend is that not only is the share price going to be adjusted down by the amount of the dividend, your put contract strike price will be adjusted down as well. By the amount of the dividend. So that 55 strike put you bought is now a $36.25 strike. 

It‚Äôs (probably) not going to vaporize your account the way that a bunch of short box spreads can (praise be to 1ronyman, patron saint of free money), but it‚Äôs not going to be the massive winner you think.

26,wallstreetbets,Didi took $13 billion in cash from American investors and days later the Chinese government shutdown the app.,"And, to top it off, the CCP is now discussing scrapping the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure through which foreign investors have ""invested"" in Chinese companies. [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china\_considers\_closing\_loophole\_used\_by\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/)

(For a primer on the VIE structure and the risks it poses to American and other foreign investors looking to invest in China, see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets\_getting\_infiltrated\_by\_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets_getting_infiltrated_by_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3) )

Wonder if American and other foreign investors will \*finally\* get the memo with Didi here. If the CCP wanted American and foreign investors to lose the maximum right out of the gate, they could not have timed this move any better. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose substantial risks to the company‚Äôs operations or business. Is there any credible evidence to suggest Didi execs were completely unaware the app was at risk of an imminent shutdown when the company filed its 10-K?

Someone lied. It's either the CCP or Didi itself (which, let's be honest, is likely little more than an alter ego for the CCP anyways, given the usual governmental presence required on boards and the like).

This lack of reciprocity cannot continue. The US government cannot and should not let Chinese companies list here unless they meet the same disclosure requirements that American companies meet under the prevailing securities acts and implementing regulations. Foreign investors in China must have access to the Chinese courts to litigate securities fraud actions, just as happens here on the flipside in the US (recall that Huawei/CCP was able to judicially challenge the Trump Administration's proposed ban in American court).

Unless and until that happens, the lesson is clear: stay away from Chinese offerings. The CCP shows once again it has absolutely no qualms about deceiving and pulling the rug on foreign investors. This is definitely part of a larger pattern of the CCP flexing on foreign investors (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip\_jack/gi0cl58/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip_jack/gi0cl58/); [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla\_gang\_heavy\_sigh\_of\_relief\_dont\_want\_to\_get/ghuxevt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla_gang_heavy_sigh_of_relief_dont_want_to_get/ghuxevt/)). The risk is just not worth it. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why\_nio\_will\_be\_the\_next\_apple\_and\_the\_leader\_of/h38v0qm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why_nio_will_be_the_next_apple_and_the_leader_of/h38v0qm/)

Edit: oh, right! I forgot to mention all the widespread reverse merger scams that plagued the markets a decade ago: 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_21st-century_Chinese_reverse_mergers

INB4:

1. Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. But more to the point, with respect to all of these, the US has securities fraud laws to protect investors here; if they've been injured, and lies or fraudulent statements were made, then the offending company can be haled into court to answer for it, \*including\* by foreigners who invested in them. Theranos, like Enron, has even spawned a criminal process in addition to the civil one.

Tell me: do you, as a foreigner, have the right to demand a judicial remedy in Chinese court against the CCP or a SOE for, e.g., fraudulently rugpulling the VIE structure? Do you, as a foreign investor, have the right to hale Luckin Coffee into Chinese court for securities fraud?

There is no reciprocity. And that's the nub of the problem. As a foreign investor in China, you will get burned, and \*there is nothing you can do about it\* (unlike foreign investors here in the US).

2. Ohh, silly person, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry. Recall the National Security Law and Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed. The CCP more likely envisions itself as Bruce Willis in this scene from Die Hard 4: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps) . Yes, it injures itself, but it weakens or takes out its foreign competition in the process. The CCP has shown time and again it's more concerned above all else with consolidating its power. It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.

Edit

INB4 no. 3: You and this post are racist. It‚Äôs racist to point out that either the CCP or Didi is bilking investors here of all ethnicities and creeds? I think not. Moreover, this is a common wumao tactic often used on social media. They‚Äôve learned they can deflect from the CCP‚Äôs misdeeds by crying any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist.

Edit edit:
Hell, let‚Äôs go even further! Assume I am indeed a racist (I‚Äôm not). How does that factually alter, rebut, or contend with the substance of *anything* I‚Äôve said here?

Edit edit edit: 

INB4 no. 4: You can take Chinese companies to Chinese court for securities fraud. All right. Now consider the following: A big reason for this latest Didi fiasco is, the US demanded that Chinese companies comply with typical US disclosure requirements. And this reluctance on China's part to disclose is because of the way the government has permeated the larger companies, so it refuses based on national security grounds. https://www.ft.com/content/feb85200-a7f1-4cab-bc8e-f02cd6fd0590

Given this linkage between the state and enterprise, and given the state's preoccupation with national security, an injured foreign investor likely wouldn't be able to obtain the information in discovery needed to make his case; it would all be withheld in the interests of safeguarding information related to ""national security"". The courthouse doors may as well be shut given such flimsy process. Not so here in the US, where there is no such outright permeation of the government in publicly-traded companies.

Edit Edit Edit Edit: I do not have a position in Didi--have not bought or sold a single share or contract.

Edit x 5. Here is a good Bogleheads primer/discussion on some of the differences between Chinese VIEs and the usual ADRs via which foreign companies are more usually traded. https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=292674",0.95,6245.0,0.0,6245.0

44,wallstreetbets,Does index inclusion positively affect stock price? : I analyzed 300+ stocks that were added to S&amp;P500 over the past 3 decades. Here are the results!,"**Preamble:** There is a lot of publicity generated when a company is added to the S&amp;P 500 or Russell Indices. The company usually gets a bump in stock price following the announcement and there is a significant increase in retail interest for the stock.

The underlying principle for this is that institutional investors which track these indices would have to buy into the stock and that this would cause a considerable bump in the stock price.

At the same time, there are some contradictory opinions regarding this expected jump in price. Some people believe that there would be profit booking following the index inclusion which would actually tank the stock price.

What I wanted to analyze was

**Whether the stock price rise following index inclusion or would the profit booking cause to stock price to fall?**

This in turn would allow us to create the best strategy for trading using index inclusion news.

**Data:** The data for index inclusion time was surprisingly difficult to obtain. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies)¬†list from Wikipedia was the only source where I could find when each stock was added to S&amp;P 500. Data from official sources are split by years and only the latest years‚Äô data is provided on the website.

All the data and my analysis are shared as a Google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

One of the major limitations of S&amp;P500 index inclusions is that there is no set time delay between the date of announcement of inclusion and the actual inclusion \[1\]. As detailed in [this post](https://www.thestreet.com/tesla/articles/when-will-tesla-be-added-to-the-s-p-500), it can vary from 1 day to 10 days with the average being 6 days.

To incorporate this complexity also into the analysis, we will calculate the returns of the stock (keeping the date of inclusion as the benchmark)

a. 1-week leading up to the index inclusion

b.¬†1-week following the index inclusion

c.¬†1-month following the index inclusion

**Results:**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/qsax10i4nz971.png?width=947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a02ec75a31b64e02711ccb13c0033146687a5fdd)

As expected, on average the stocks made positive returns only during the week leading up to the index inclusion. Out of the 313 stocks analyzed, more than 60% had positive returns with an average return of 1.7%.

After the stock had been added to the index, the returns on average were negative. There is a consistent drop in the stock price in the following weeks after the index addition. On average, the stocks lost 0.7% in the week after the index inclusion. One probable reason for this would be profit booking where investors pull out after the run-up leading to the index addition.

We can further deep dive into the mechanics of index addition to understand the best possible plays. For this, we will take case studies of some popular stocks that were added to the index.

**Domino‚Äôs Pizza ($DPZ)**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/yyg21nh6nz971.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a5534e2ac5180ace000bd41e88ec373caeed776)

The inclusion of Dominos into S&amp;P500 was announced on 6th May 2020 and the date of inclusion was on 12th May 2020. As we can observe from the graph, all the indices which track S&amp;P 500 had to buy Domino‚Äôs stock before the market open on 12th May due to which there is almost an 11x jump in traded volume and a 2% gain in stock price. In this case, the stock continued its upward trend for one more day before dipping.

**Tesla Inc ($TSLA)**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/sq0l4ak7nz971.png?width=873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0662bd22d1acb150c14e9cc578100432a255a930)

Tesla was the largest company to be added to S&amp;P 500 at more than $500 Billion valuation. The inclusion of Tesla into S&amp;P500 was announced on 16th Nov 2020 and the date of inclusion was on 21st Dec 2020. As we can see from the graph, there was a nice bump in traded volume as well as stock price following the announcement.

Since the company was added into the index in one step before the 21st Dec open, all the funds had to buy the stock on 18th Dec (19 &amp; 20 were weekends). There was a 6% jump in stock price and almost 4x normal traded volume on that day. We can also see the profit booking following the index addition where the stock briefly dipped before continuing on its rally. ¬†¬†

**Conclusion:**

The analysis does prove that stock prices positively react to index inclusion. But this is only applicable till the stock is added to the index. As we saw earlier, stocks rise 1 week leading to the inclusion and then fall due to profit booking.

So, the best strategy to trade based on index addition is to buy the stock as soon as the news breaks and hold it till the day of inclusion.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] If you are a diligent investor, you can analyze the quarterly earnings report and understand whether the company is now in a position to be added to the index. But then again, the final decision of whether a stock will be added to the index will be based on the [index committee](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-brochure.pdf)

54,wallstreetbets,Be Careful Buying the Homebuilder &amp; Building Materials Dip!,"The reason the housing market boomed was because ‚Ä¶

1. Record low interest rates (Self Explanatory and the FED will raise them sooner than originally thought.)

2. The rent moratorium (Drove up the price of rent beyond that of a mortgage because the price of folks not paying their rent had to be passed on to new renters) This incentivized buying, not renting. 

3. Mortgage forbearance (Folks didn‚Äôt have to make full mortgage payments keeping them in their homes) This allowed people to stay in their homes rather than sell them for the equity. 

So mortgage forbearance and the rent moratorium is mostly coming to an end this month. Moreover all the money that should have been going to rent and mortgages got spent in the general economy, creating the boom we have right now. Folks will still be charged for the rent and mortgage they missed out on during the pandemic and we are likely to see evictions skyrocket! Suddenly the folks gaming the system will have ruined credit and leans placed against all their property. The housing market may dump. And money that was being spent in the economy will go back to paying rent and mortgages. Moreover building materials have skyrocketed yet these builders are under contract to produce at a certain price. A lot can go wrong here.

And I didn‚Äôt say anything about enhanced unemployment benefits ending yet, which will tighten the screws even more. 

Anyway for all these reasons the FED has not raised interest rates ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre just not telling us this is the reason. They got to keep money flowing when all this calamity happens. 

When all this ends folks will be booted out of apartments and you will see an increased amount of people selling their homes. Money that was flooding purchases in the non home &amp; rent market will draw back. Building materials will be more abundant lowering the price and the market for these material will be more competitive as many have expanded to produce more. This will have a chain reaction throughout the economy. So be careful about buying home builder and building material stocks when everything gets turned off later this month. This includes steel!

Food for thought Economics 101

And if you don‚Äôt think folks aren‚Äôt gaming the system, remember the case study of the EBT glitch in Louisiana. Whereas stores were raided when the balances went black on their cards and when everything came back online full Walmart shelves were emptied and carts abandoned in the grocery store isles.

After my SOFI TA yesterday I had a request for a TA of these tickers and their potential price movement in the near future. Specifically, a visualization and breakdown of stocks that seem to ""keep running.""

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical analysis.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range is within 1 statistical standard deviation of it's average/regression trend (2 blue lines), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). These deviations also function, generally, as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

\-ZTS - Moving on news and hype since 3/8/2020. Here is the One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart - Bottom of page

ZTS has currently broken through all deviation resistance levels over the past 4-5 months however it is now at over +2 Deviations on both the One Year and 6 Month chart which indicates it is entering extremely overbought territory. Both + 2 Deviation Support Levels are $195. Should it crack through that soon, we should see prices back down to the +1 Deviation Support Level or $185. Now is not a good time to enter. The Stock has entered its selling phase and can easily crash a full deviation price swing in one day. Should it manage to continue upward, we could see prices around $205 (+3 Deviations) although this is unlikely.

\-FB - One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart - bottom of page

FB has pretty much made it's long-term move for now. It was not able to break +1 Deviation Resistance around 355-358 on the 6 Month Chart. And its +1 Deviation Support on the 1 Year chart is $350, which it broke through pre-market. It is entering the selling phase and we should see prices back around the $321-328 Area, its long-term regression trend, before any deviation support helps to bounce it.

\-AMZN - One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart - bottom of page

On Amazon's One year chart, it has tended to trend between +3 deviations, crash to -2 Deviations, then bounce, with most of the action happening between +1/-1 Deviations following the typical sine-wave like cyclical price pattern seen in many stocks. In the immediate future, it is, like FB, statistically overbought, hovering above +2 deviation support levels of $3500 and $3600 which it is likely to break soon and trend back to it's regression price of 3300-3350. Not the time to buy.

\-NVDA - One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart - bottom of page

It seems NVDA has finally completed its run up to +2 Deviation resistance on both charts, as you can see it bouncing off the 1st purple line this week. This indicates a bearish move to the downside after being extremely overbought the last 3 months. Our downside buy area would be between $665-678 and the immediate deviation support at +1 on both charts is $748-756 where it will likely try to hold trend before snapping down to it's regression trend line.

Hope these images help you all visualize price trends of these stocks. Good luck trading today!

79,wallstreetbets,"Unilever - Klondike, Ben and Jerry's OH MY! - DD on $UL","# Unilever PLC (UL)

First things first: Unilever is the only major consumer staple company that has significant operations in the Personal  Care + Home Care and Package Goods. I am going to list every brand in this post because there is nobody here to stop me.

# Lets talk about the dividend

Historically, Unilever's dividend per share has been growing at around 6.3% on an annual basis. The growth rate accelerated to 6.9% over the past 5 years, even though Unilever was one of the few large-cap consumer staple companies that did not engage in share buybacks in 2019 and 2020. Thus, if we assume that dividend per share will grow at 6% per year for the next 5 years and will then revert back to a 2% growth to be consistent with inflation, Unilever's implied share price based on a Dividend Discount Model (DDM) in Euros comes at **61.2 which is 29% higher** than what it currently trades at in Amsterdam.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bmgrt8vgc1a71.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1c7cd82d34f42c21fd99d1fa75ea14baf68afec

The Company's segments include **Personal Care**, which primarily includes sales of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and oral care products; **Food**, which primarily includes sales of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings and margarines; **Home Care**, which primarily includes sales of home care products, such as powders, liquids and capsules, soap bars and a range of cleaning products; and Refreshment, which primarily includes sales of ice cream and tea-based beverages. While business fundamentals are improving, Unilever still trades below its fair value while offering a 3.3% dividend yield. The company generates massive amounts of free cash flow and is attractively priced, offering (one of) the highest dividend yields amongst its peers.

# What is the challenge?

**They are trying to target consumers across so many geographies that operate more as separate companies that happen to have the same owner.** That‚Äôs why, in spite of Unilever's iconic and high price premium brands, the company's margins are still lower than most of its major peers in the Personal &amp; Home Care and Packaged Foods industries.

On one side of the coin, the Personal Care &amp; Beauty space offers a much higher price premium comparing EBITDA margins of  companies in the sector with those of the Packaged Foods industry.  On the other side, Unilever's personal care brands, such as Lifebuoy, Dove and Sunsilk, are among the top 10 global FMCG (Fast-moving consumers goods are nondurable products) brands by footprint.

# Unilever still trades below its fair value while offering a 3.3% dividend yield.

The  company generates massive amounts of free cash flow and is attractively  priced, offering (one of) the highest dividend yields amongst its  peers. **Unilever is changing rapidly.** A conservatively valued company with many of  the world's strongest brands and best-in-class distribution network, it  looks very attractive for long-term shareholders.¬† 

**Ticker**: Unilever

**Rating**: Overweight

**Price Target:** $71

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's a screenshot from the may-june window](https://preview.redd.it/owutuexqx2a71.png?width=1243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa73d02f26777e6c307c32d757fcd597b88b5aa6)

&amp;#x200B;

So, above is May to June. There are 3 major indicators I want to bring attention to, and specifically call out the circled date of May 12 + 13.  


First, MACD histogram is reaaaaaly low, but didn't have much variation from the day before, suggesting the price is settling. The MFI (10 period) is showing a # well below midpoint 40 (admittedly not in the ""hey stupid, this is way undersold"" level of below 20, but it's glanced off it the day before and is climbing. The A/D was negative at a low with very little variation from the day before. These numbers, with the green candlestick + red volume suggest one thing to me:  


We're at a low point. This is historical and we can see that yes this is some of the lows and it climbs quite a bit up. May not go to the moon like GME is hoping for, but this is a low.  


Now, let's take a look at today:

Notice anything? MACD low, but without much variation from the day before. MFI substantially below the midpoint? Green candlestick with red volume? A/D at some low numbers with not too terribly much variation from the day before? hmm...Wonder where I might have seen that before...

 In particular, this company has been rumored to cooperate with TESLA before, but the stock price is still falling daily. It is obvious that someone is maliciously shorting, and now the turnover rate of $MMAT is maintained below 10%, which means that APES is in SH. 

The Short squeeze score of $MMAT on [Fintel.com](https://Fintel.com) has risen to 96.88, ranking third. In addition, $MMAT itself is also a promising company, so I believe the stock price can rise to at least $200 in the future, and APES can consider this new battlefield.

The company offers gamer and creator peripherals, including gaming keyboards, mice, headsets, and controllers, as well as capture cards, stream decks, USB microphones, studio accessories, and EpocCam software. It also provides gaming components and systems comprising power supply units, cooling solutions, computer cases, and DRAM modules, as well as prebuilt and custom-built gaming PCs, and others; and PC gaming software comprising iCUE for gamers and Elgato's streaming suite for content creators.

The company IPO'd in Sep of 2020 so still new to the market and slightly undiscovered. Once discovered and potential realized, this should be trading over $100 long term. See below for more info.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Latest Quarter (Q1 2021) results and reseller list:**

Price to earning is now trading 1.5 times, if we compare that to peers or SPY, they trade about 3-4 time PE ratio. Corsair is extremely undervalued growth gem and once discovered, should be at a fair value of about $70/per share now (being conservative).

Chart is trading near bottom and is looking to reverse upward, recent jump to $43 two weeks ago, now trading around $32/share.

* **Technicals:**

If we look at what $NEGG did today, chart moved from $28 where it was trading flat for awhile then BOOM, moved to about $80. That's all in one day, NEGG has ""less than ideal"" of a balance sheet/financials comparing to $CRSR but the chart pattern was primed. CRSR has a similar setup on chart, could move even higher given that it has less shares and excellent fundamentals to support a large move and higher price per share.

89,wallstreetbets,$WKHS: Exciting Things in the Coming Months!,"I know Workhorse has been mentioned a lot on this board (&amp; it deserves to be!) This company in the tail-end of 2021 and 2022 will truly breakout. I believe much of Wall Street only considers WKHS as yet another EV company (which explains the high short %) but it's so much more.

&amp;#x200B;

Drones:

Toward the end of this year, Workhorse will likely gain FAA approval for their drone usage. This is monumental as not only a first-mover in the space but as a company that has been testing with federal/[local governments](https://dronelife.com/2021/06/08/nuair-leads-the-way-for-safe-drone-operations-over-people-workhorse-and-avss-collaboration/) and [UPS](https://www.fleetowner.com/covid-19-coverage/article/21129382/ups-and-workhorse-test-drones-to-help-covid19-response). UPS has been testing Workhorse drones for about 5 years now as they are preparing to get into drone delivery - in fact, they have purchased [950 trucks](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/). With Workhorse's PATENTED drone technology to fit their electric truck landing space, this will be a huge asset to the company. I digress, back to drones. Ark Invest  estimates that at some point during the next five years, drones will deliver more than 20% of parcel shipments.

https://preview.redd.it/6sg0mhe35u971.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36d3b200d027430e698a69499204a03beaf6be31

Refrigerated Trucks:

Online food delivery sales grew more than 40% globally in 2020. As of their last earnings call, Workhorse announced that they will begin prototypes for refrigerated delivery trucks this year.  Workhorse was approached by some LARGE companies inquiring about the possibility of a REFRIGERATED version of their giant 1000 cubic foot Zero Emission Electric Step Van the C-1000.  The Workhorse COO is the former Director of Fleet Operations for Sysco, whose 14,000 vehicle fleet is largely 1000 cubic ft Refrigerated Trucks.  Their HQ is right next to Kroger's HQ btw.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, I think Workhorse is in the first inning of their growth stage right now. I truly see this stock retesting its highs by early next year. There are a lot of first mover advantages and spaces where there is NO competition. As they continue to develop, go through the legal processes and progress their product line, they will gain market share and big name customers.

CLF is a US steel manufacturing company, one of the worlds largest, and environmentally cleanest.  Says they: ""Cleveland-Cliffs is the largest flat-rolled steel company and the  largest iron ore pellet producer in North America. The company is vertically integrated from mining through iron making, steelmaking,  rolling, finishing and downstream with hot and cold stamping of steel  parts and components.¬†"" It is not new to WSB, usually\~ top 25 tickers mentioned prior 10y.

Now there is a monstrous ""Infrastructure"" bill being considered (bridges, roads, rail) for \~1 T USD Will it pass? We will see. That is the play here. It is a straight fundamentals/value play, with a transformative binary event coming.

TBD consider- on the plus side, all the steel needed to correct crumbling bridges, falling condo towers, the rebar for concrete, and the new Amtrak rail proposition...most all of this will come from steel made by CLF. It is a domestic pay to play contracting deal. CLF knows this. They have aquired Arcelor Mittal and AK steel to become THE player that will directly benefit from the passage of the bill. There are financial minuses. To doot:

PLUSES:

YUGE Infrastructure Contrax Potentate Transformer events imminent

110MM in cash

Profitable with 4 BB in revenue per Q (!!)

10x positive momentum, from the 2020 trough

2/3 of ownership is institutional / bullish hedges (Lazard, Wellington, Victory, Berkshire/Buffet, Viking et al)

Short float &gt;10%

Cramer likes it

&amp;#x200B;

MINUSES:

Massive Insider purchase/sell churn of 40 MM shares / 12 mos. Why?

Debt=Assets = 6BB

""Other Liabilities"" = 6BB (WTF are those??)

Short float &gt;10%

&amp;#x200B;

OVERALL

The next week will determine if the Senate will pass this infrastructure thing. It is NOT CLEAR if the 1716 bipartisan earmarks funds for politicians home districts (""pork barrel profit"") will be enough to guarantee votes to pass this overstuffed pig through the Senate. This is the sub-Trillion dollar Jabba the Hutt of bills, being shoved through the door before another election, while its still possible. Negotiation is happening. A few R votes were in swing districts. However, only a few moderate/conservative seantors are needed now. It is also not clear overall if politics will interfere (despite everyone wanting to fund infrastructure), because D are demanding a concomitant social reparation and reconciliation bill, and holding this one hostage, to get equality repaired. This game of chicken will end, one way or another. Ind/Green are on board, for what minor impacts that it matters to. Usually, veterans, energy, environment, and infrastructure are political sacred cows that dont go begging, and the parties can get past theirselves to fund something. Right now the Inf bill and the D hold a 2% advantage, and that is all that's needed. The benefit is to the home CLF steel plants in MI and MN are accompanied by powerful senators Klobuchar and Stabenow. It's big, it's ugly, it's lobbied sausage. We proceed, woke to that. I assert nothing here of disparaging nature, the company is solid and, Can Do.

Obviously the CEO Goncalves has repositioned the company with aquisitions and debt leverage to take advantage of the possibility of a monster legislative win for this profitable domestic steel company. There is a gigantic balance sheet with big sleeping line items that only a professional forensic accountant could detail accurately in order to assess true risk (not myself, I just Like the Stonk). But Goncalves thinks that this Godzilla of spending will pass, and that negotiations this week will make it run. Normally mining and basic materials are boring. NOT this week.

Is it all ""priced in"" already ? No. Personally I think the 113 missing people from the Miamo condo, the worsening climate, buckling NW roads, and the possibilty to rebuild Amtrak, but using massive amounts of CLF steel to build new rail etc. will make this a triple bag over the next Q, even w/o Options. Revenue is up for 4 Q straight. There is overall gross political alignment and momentum. Only the trigger remains.

We are building, we are emerging from pandemic isolation to find buckled roads, falling structures, and no war to suck up commodities. This is the spend, this is the company. If you dont like it, you can go pound sand with Vulcan Materials $VMC and do a concrete play, or pump copper with the $COPX ETF. I dont own those. Disclaimer: I have 100 CLF shares, considering more if I can dump some volatile biotech.

This short analysis is my own. Do your DD, find out for yourselves, you beautiful retards, I love you. Maybe CLF will too.

Best of luck

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1: While the numbers for CLF are all available for DD, the political needs work here; getting DMs. Did not mean to imply the vote was today. Therefore the timeline is updated to Jul 31, TBD before the August recess. I could not find a shceduled vote for a finished product. A call for a House vote was made today by a particular caucus. Tester (MT) believes there are 11-17  R that will vote for it. Legislation is being written frenetically right now. Differences of position between Biden, Pelosi, Shumer, McConnell, and Manchin are apparently nearly addressed. Apparently the goal is to craft a bill that can pass, work it out before hand, and the riders and reconciliation will get included or not depending on who they can get. Last there was a 700B water infrastructure bill not to be confused with this one, and the current infrastructure bill range reputedly is much larger, 1.2T even by some estimates. Thanks

Edit 2 : Important commentary on the market and timeline is digested here. Several have noted the presence of competitors Nucor, CMC, SDI, Gerdau in the rebar market. These makers have raised their steel prices by 40-50/st recently. Yet steel futures are astronomically high right now and are not going down. It was pointed out that 70% of the steel market is scrap. However, China is reputedly out of scrap steel now. It was further pointed out the the original Cleveland Cliffs makes iron pellet as basic fabrication stock, not completed steel product. Now the recent grab of Arcelor Mittal cold roll sheet and other products is what makes the new CLF ""vertically integrated"". The post stands. If anything these comments underscore the importance of CLF balance sheet being positive and growing. The slow speed of the congressional action getting to actual CLF books is appreciated. Thanks

Edit 3: Re: Cramer. The visceral, rapid response to even mentioning the guys name has honestly taken me aback. He really evokes something primal in this community. That deserves some reflection and thought. Only one day in, I awoke this morning to another dozen messages about it. As soon as the name was mentioned in the post, a knee jerk reaction apparently went off. Many stopped reading and started writing. Several missed that he was also listed as a negative, so it has to be inferred they didnt get to the overall content summary. Admittedly that following content was a wall of text, but others appreciated it and awarded. Apologies if the attempt at humor botched. Thanks.

For this post I will neither defend nor attack the guy libelously (if thats a word). There is some useful content to his analysis; but there's also great suspicion and even hatred in this community. It's broader than just $CLF. So, I hear and appreciate that. However someone else will have to fully characterize and comment on it. I dont get it fully, obviously.  Theres history there. Hopefully we Apes can all keep our heads on. Apologies for my stepping on an apparent landmine. Point noted.

In a reverse repo,  the opposite happens. The Fed exchanges U.S gov't treasuries for cash, essentially removing liquidity out of the banking system.

Commercial bank's are required to keep what's known as a  reserve requirement to ensure liquidity.  As deposits (from people making more money as a result of new money being printed) into banks increases, the amount of capital a bank must keep as a reserve also increases.

The problem is, banks can't loan out capital that's being used to meet reserve requirements.

Additionally, in March of 2021, the Fed ended the rules that relaxed the supplementary leverage ratio which allowed banks to exclude treasuries and deposit from their reserve requirements which means banks are now (once again) required to hold more capital for reserves.

In order to loan out these new deposits, Banks are telling their corporate customer's to put their money in money-market accounts (since these don't require banks to keep capital as reserves). (See: [https://www.ft.com/content/a5e165f7-a524-4b5b-9939-de689b6a1687](https://www.ft.com/content/a5e165f7-a524-4b5b-9939-de689b6a1687)) . As a result of this, the size of money market funds are increasing dramatically. ([https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-investments-by-fund-category/](https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-investments-by-fund-category/)).

Money-market funds buy short dated U.S treasuries (t-bills), but as the demand and use of these funds goes up, the supply of U.S treasuries is decreasing.

This is why over-night reverse repurchase agreements are spiking. Banks are exchanging their cash for these short dated treasuries.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, the Fed is buying over $80 bln worth of U.S treasuries a month ([https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/treasury-securities/treasury-securities-operational-details](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/treasury-securities/treasury-securities-operational-details)), and at the same time the U.S treasury department is underwriting less short dated bonds (in favor of 2, 5, and 10 years)  to make long term debt cheaper.

&amp;#x200B;

This means that either the T-bill market is going to squeeze. Or (the more likely outcome) is that the Fed slows open market operations, and removes liquidity by raising interest rates earlier than expected.

&amp;#x200B;

My bet is emergency rate hike before Sept. The U.S debt ceiling requirements are kicking back in at the end of July as well.

&amp;#x200B;

This will probably cause a drop in the equities, but idk what do y'all think?

tl;dr: That guy buying the $40 $SPY 7/16 puts might be onto something.
